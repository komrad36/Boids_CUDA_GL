// The most time-critical part of flocking simulation is the
// nearest-neighbor search, which is O(n^2). The rest of the simulation
// is O(n) with a small constant term - up to 98% of execution time is
// spent in the O(n^2) part. Obviously, improving this is critical to
// increasing performance. One option is the construction
// of a k-d tree for each frame, to be reused by all boids. However, a
// faster, though approximative, alternative takes advantage of the fact that
// boids do not change much from one frame to the next - a "neighborhood matrix"
// that, instead of being sorted every frame, is merely sifted a few times.
// This makes the critical code section O(r^2), where m is the Moore neighborhood
// radius, typically small compared to n! The speedups can be enormous - I have
// demonstrated one MILLION birds at 70 frames per second on an overclocked GTX 780m.
// HOWEVER - as the intent of this program is mainly aesthetic
// (hence the color being determined by direction of travel), and as
// properties which contribute to this, such as screen wrapping, strong
// mouse attraction, and excessively high rule strengths, all are
// detrimental to the performance of the neighborhood matrix approximation,
// I provide both options and typically do not actually use the matrix method.
// With careful tweaking a realstic simulation can be produced with it, but
// retaining the aesthetic quality due to the factors mentioned above
// requires high settings for number of sifts per frame and Moore
// neighborhood radius, thus reducing performance significantly while
// still not quite looking as nice as the exact mode. I thus default
// the application to the exact mode, but matrix mode can be enabled
// for experimentation here:
//
// NOTE: I highly recommend disabling screen wrap if neighborhood matrix
// is enabled, as birds disappearing from one edge and reappearing on the other
// violates the assumption of the matrix that the birds do not change much from
// one frame to the next, resulting in simulation inaccuracy.
